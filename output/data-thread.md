Saving things on reddit is great, and you can view saved items by subreddit with gold. But having them organized in bookmarks could be useful for a few things:

1. Losing your account, deleting your account, wanting to start a new account. You would still have your saved posts somewhere. 

2. Your bookmarks are easily view-able on different devices through syncing. 

3. You won't need to be signed in to reddit to view things you've saved. 

As someone who had a bunch of saved posts in an account I forgot the password to while at the same time losing RES settings, having those saved posts in organized bookmarks would have been amazing. 

Users who get shadowbanned or whatever without warning could also benefit from this.
