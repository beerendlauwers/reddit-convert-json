Hey! I got it to work finally. Had to get Python going first, all modules set up. I k**meow** the default limit from the API is 25, maximum 100. Is there anything to do to get past that? So the script only downloads 25 saved links right **meow**. I k**meow** with apps like AlienBlue, you just have to pull down to get more, which I'm assuming just counts as a separate API call to get more. Is there any way to do something similar with this? 

"

FTFY
